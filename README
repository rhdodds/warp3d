                 Highest Level README File for WARP3D
                 ====================================

                   Last Update: July 1, 2019

                  Version 18.1.5 on all platforms

** The multiple README files in previous releases are replaced with the
** QuickStart documents on home page of www.warp3d.net

The remaining information below provides a summary of the various
directories in the WARP3D distribution for this interested in such details.


  src  (a directory)
  ===

  Fortran source code and processes to re-build the executables on each hardware
  platform.

  Linux and Mac OS users:
     We provide a general building script, Makewarp.bash
     which interactively guides you through the
     building process for both threaded (OpenMP) and MPI+threaded versions.
     use this for both Intel Fortran and gfortran builds. The script
     asks you to select the compiler system.
     **** This is the ONLY method you should use to build the code ****

  Windows users:
     We provide a general building script, Makewarp.bat
     The is a bat file executed in a command shell and uses nmake
     supplied as part of windows. Source files are compiled sequentially.
     It compiles and binds a new executable using the Windows nmake program.
     **** This is the ONLY method you should use to build the code ****
     
     The file Makewarp_jom.bat makes use of the Jom version of nmake which
     compiles source files in parallel (much faster!). Install this tool
     from https://wiki.qt.io/Jom.

  Refer to the README file for each specific platform for full details on
  re-building the code.


  run_<platform>  (multiple directories)
  ==============

  Location for executable files. Our build scripts put them
  in this directory. We distribute ready-to-run executables for Linux, Mac OS
  and Windows. The Makewarp.bash and Makewarp.bat scripts create the
  object and run directories as needed during the build process. Examples:
  run_linux, run_mac_os_x,..
  The Windows, Linux and MacOS executables support parallel execution using
  threads (OpenMP) and shared-memory.
  Linux also supports parallel execution using a hybrid MPI + OpenMP framework.
  This executable is named warp3d.mpi_omp while the
  version that uses only OpenMP for threaded execution is called warp3d.omp.

  run_windows  (directory)
  ===========================

  Pre-compiled, thread-parallel executable for warp3d. The patwarp
  executable runs serial only. The executables are statically linked.

  The Intel compiler system is NOT required to use the ready-to-run
  executable provided is this directory.

  The MPI version of WARP3D is not supported on Windows.

  The Intel sparse solver (Pardiso) is included in these executables - both
  the direct and iterative options in Pardiso. Pardiso runs in parallel
  using threads if multiple cores are available.

  The Windows version of WARP3D uses OpenMP (threads) to achieve very efficient
  parallel execution.

  Note: we continue to have issues on some Windows 7/8/10 machines with the
        system dll:  libiomp5md.dll
        We include a current version of this DLL in the run_windows_64
        directory.

        In some instances, we see the warp3d.exe in that same directory
        fail to start properly with a Windows pop-up window saying The
        Application Failed to Start Properly ...

        Renaming libiomp5md.dll to save_libiomp5md.dll fixes the problem.

  run_linux  (a directory)
  ==============================

  Pre-compiled executables for WARP3D, patwarp, combine_mpi_results.
  Both threaded (OpenMP) and MPI + OpenMP versions are provided for WARP3D.
  These have been built using Intel Fortran. The threads only executable
  built with gfortran is included.

    a) To use the threads only version, no Intel compiler/MPI
       software is required to be installed on your system

    b) To use the MPI version, you must have Intel MPI runtime
       software installed that provides the runtime setup for MPI jobs

  WARP3D on Linux uses a number of shared libraries, including MKL, at run time.
  These are included with the WARP3D distribution and are located in the
  directory linux_packages of the distribution.

  By using the latest shared MKL libraries included in the distribution on Linux,
  the highest performance on each type of hardware is reached w/o re-compiling.
  Intel permits re-distribution of these MKL libraries.

  To re-build the threaded WARP3D executable, you need the Intel Fortran compiler
  suite or gfortran. To re-build the MPI + OpenMP threaded version, 
  the Intel MPI system must be installed.

  run_mac_os_x  (a directory)
  ===========================

  Pre-compiled executables for WARP3D, patwarp, combine_mpi_results.
  These are built with Intel Fortran. The gfortran built executable is 
  also included.

  The Mac OS version of WARP3D uses OpenMP (threads) to achieve very efficient
  parallel execution.

  The Intel sparse solver (Pardiso) is included in these executables - both
  the direct and iterative options in Pardiso.

  The Intel Fortran compiler system is NOT required to use the ready-to-run
  executable provided is this directory.

  To re-build the WARP3D executable, you need the Intel Fortran compiler
  system or gfortran. The building process runs
  from the Terminal window via the Makewarp.bash script -- answer the
  questions.

  patwarp  (directory)
  ====================

  Fortran code and compile scripts for the patwarp program.
  In a shell window, just execute the compile script and choose
  the platform on which to compile.

  Note that each platform has a different compile script. Linux and
  Mac OS have Bash scripts. Windows has a .bat file. The executables
  are placed into the warp3d_project/run_<platform> directory.

  MacOS and Windows require only the Intel Fortran compiler or gfortran.

  Linux also requires the C-compiler (gcc) to build Metis .o files. The
  Intel Fortran compiler or gfortran compiler may be used for the Fortran
  parts of patwarp

  The patwarp program converts Patran neutral files for finite element
  models into WARP3D input files. It also supports definition of 9, 12,
  15 node transition elements that are partially supported by Patran.

  On Linux patwarp includes/uses the METIS package to provide mesh partitioning
  for MPI-based parallel execution. METIS is included in the patwarp directory,
  and is automatically compiled from the patwarp compile script for Linux.

  warp3d2exii (directory)
  =======================

  Contains a Python (2.7.3 or later) program to create an ExodusII (.exo) database
  for post-processing by ParaView and other programs.

  The program is warp3d2exii (formerly named pat2exII)

  warp3d2exII does the following:

    1) reads flat model description file produced by WARP3D
       (see manual Section 2.12)

    2) then reads WARP3D generated "flat" result files (_text, 
       _stream or _text.gz)

  The Exodus II database can be used by ParaView to post-process computed
  displacements, strains, stresses, etc. on the FE model. It is an
  exceptionally powerful tool (open source) with key visualization
  capabilities usable with minimal introduction to the program.

  The Cubit program can use the database to access the FE model for
  further meshing, re-meshing, new constraints, boundary conitions etc.

  The Python source code for warp3d2exII runs on Windows, Linux and
  MacOS. A Python environment on your machine will be
  needed.

  ===>>  Python version 2.7.3 or later is required to run warp3d2exii.

         See additional discussion about Python requirements in the README
         file of this directory.

  license_agreement  (a file)
  ===========================

  Terms and conditions of the no cost Open Source license with terms and
  conditions of the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.

  linux_packages  (a directory)
  =============================

  This directory contains the source code, include files and shared
  libraries needed to provide the additional functionality on Linux.
  Specifically MKL, MPI and the hypre iterative solver from LLNL.

  The shared libraries are accessed during re-build and
  execution (gfortran) and during execution (Intel Fortran).

  If you are building from the GitHub source, complete loading of 
  these libraries by running the bash shell script

        install_libs_from_remote

  in the WARP3D directory.

  OSX_MKL_files (a directory)
  ===========================

  Contains the freely distributed Intel MKL library files needed 
  to rebuild and run WARP3D on Mac OS using Intel Fortran or
  gfortran. The libraries are accessed during re-build and
  execution (gfortran) and during execution (Intel Fortran).

  If you are building from the GitHub source, complete loading of 
  these libraries by running the bash shell script

        install_libs_from_remote

  in the WARP3D directory.

  manual  (a directory)
  =====================

  Contains the WARP3D users manual, warp3d_manual_<version>.pdf. There
  is one .pdf file for the entire manual. It is fully bookmarked.

  This is the technical report published by the University of Illinois.
  The WARP3D manual is written using a combination of MS-Word, LaTeX,
  and QuickSilver (formerly named Interleaf).

  We are gradually converting the entire manual to LaTex. Let us know if
  you want the .tex docs and all figures.


  warp3d_script_linux_openmp
  warp3d_script_linux_hybrid
  warp3d_script_windows
  warp3d_script_mac_os_x  (4 files)
  =================================

  Simple Bash-shell scripts that can be customized to run WARP3D for OpenMP
  parallel execution and combined MPI + OpenMP parallel execution.
  Our groups put versions of these scripts in the ~/bin directory of users.



  verification (multiple subdirectories)
  ============

  Users are highly encouraged to exercise the software verification
  facilities located here.

  This is our key tool to verify most all of WARP3D after making
  source code changes.

  There are multiple bash scripts (run_tests.bash, run_J_tests.bash, 
  run_mpi_tests.bash, run_J_tests_gfortran.bash, run_test_gfortran.bash).

  These interactive scripts conduct automated execution of WARP3D
  over a wide array of models/simulations and compare results to
  known good values - indicating clearly when differences arise.

  The scripts present a menu of simulations to execute. The longest
  verification problems run in a few minutes on 4-8 cores.

  On Windows, the Bash shell and Perl programs must be available.
  We highly recommend the free Cygwin software: https://www.cygwin.com


  example_problems  (5 directories)
  ================

  A series of example problems that illustrate features of WARP3D.
  Most are well documented and some have Patran.out files (neutral files
  for the models)

  Four directories are provided:

    example_problems_for_READMEs - a few problems referred to in platform
        specific README files just to test that WARP3D is installed
        properly

    manual_examples_chpt1 - WARP3D input files and supporting
        files (e.g. Python scripts to make plots) for the
        example problems described in Section 1.2 of the User Manual.

    example_problems_threads - a large collection of simple to
        complex problems set up to run in parallel using only threads.
        See README in this directory for more details.

    example_problems_mpi - problems set up to run in parallel using a
        combination of MPI and threads (Linux only at this time).
        These examples use the CPardiso & hypre (distributed iterative)
        equation solver. See README in this directory for more details.

    example_problems_cp - a set of problems that illustrate a variety of
        applications of the crystal plasticity material model. See README
        in this directory for more details.


  combine_mpi_results_files  (a directory)
  =========================

  When WARP3D runs in parallel using MPI with domain decomposition of
  the mesh, patran and flat result files are constructed piecewise by each
  process. The pieces must be combined into a single result
  file with Patran or flat file format. This directory contains the source code
  and compile script to build the combine program for each platform.

  The compile script puts the executable in the appropriate run_<platform>
  directory.


  fracture_models  (a directory)
  ===============

  A set of complete, ready-to-run models for various fracture simulations.

  The README file in the directory describes each model.

  standard_fracture_specimens (a directory)
  ===========================

  A set of complete, ready-to-run models for various standard fracture specimens (CT, 
  SCT, SEB, SSY).

  patran_templates  (a directory)
  ================

  A set of template files for use with Patran. The
  template files are accessed by Patran when the user imports
  WARP3D results (displacements, nodal strain/stresses, element
  strains/stresses, etc.) The template files inform Patran
  of the ordering of data for each node or element in the results files,
  the label that Patran displays for the result types (e.g. sigma-xx)
  in the menu of choices for display.

  We generally put the template files into the <patran>/res_templates directory
  and invoke a chmod o+rx on them. However, the template files can be placed
  and any convenient location - Patran always asks for the location.

  We often now make a copy of the template files in directories where
  Patran models are created and results post-processed. This is just for
  convenience when Patran requests the location of the temp files.

  These files are not used by ParaView for post-processing.

  packet_dir  (a directory)
  ==========

  Contains our implementation of a sample Fortran program to read the
  binary packets file of results that WARP3D can generate.
  See Appendix F of the User Manual for details about packet results.


  FEACrack_Validation.pdf  (a file)
  =======================

  Quest Reliability of Boulder, Colorado develops
  and markets a PC-based, graphical interface to WARP3D, ABAQUS
  and ANSYS for 3-D fracture analysis. As part of their development, QR
  validates the K and J solutions obtained from WARP3D, ABAQUS & ANSYS
  with each other and with analytical solutions when available.

  old_code (a directory)
  ========

  Code no longer maintained as part of the distribution but that may be
  of some use to researchers.
