1. OVERVIEW

This directory contains all the source code and makefiles for
WARP3D. All source code is in *.f files. Modules are named "mod...".

We support WARP3D on:

    o Windows (64-bit). Tested on Windows-10.
    o Linux 64-bit (tested on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS)
    o macOS 13.6.7 (built on Ventura)

We use the Intel Fortran (ifort) compiler as the primary compiler on all
3 platforms.

See the specific QuickStart files for each platform in the top level
directory.

2. MAXIMUM SIZE OF MODELS

No size limits. All global arrays are dynamically allocated.

The "main" program for WARP3D is in the file "main_program.f".

2. BUILD/COMPILE PROCESS  ** Important **

Please see the Quickstart document for each platform for complete,
up-to-date procedures to rebuild the ode on each platform.
