                        (Updated May 2014)


==========================================================================


1. OVERVIEW

This directory contains all the source code and makefiles for
WARP3D. All source code is in *.f files. Common areas are named
 "common.....". F90 modules are named "mod...".

We support WARP3D on:

    o Windows 7 (64-bit) [W8 should work]
    o Linux 64-bit (tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.10, RedHat 5.10)
    o Max OS X Lion 10.9.x

On these platforms, we use the Intel F90 & MKL compiler suite.
At present, these are at version Intel Fortran COMPOSER XE
from May 2014. We keep up with all
releases of the F90 compiler and the MKL library.

See the specific README files for each platform in the top level
directory.

2. MAXIMUM SIZE OF MODELS

The single file containing parameter definitions for the maximum size
models analyzed is "param_def". Only this file is changed to increase
or decrease the maximum problem size. Simply set:

 mxnod=####, mxel=####

"mxnod" to max number of nodes and "mxel" to the max number of elements
and run the "Makewarp.bash" script to re-compile. Likewise, the maximum "block"
size for the data structure used throughout WARP3D
is "mxvl" (usually 64 or 128).

The default version of WARP3D has mxnod and mxel set to more than
500,000 for most platforms. This should be sufficient for all but a few users.

The "main" program for WARP3D is in the file "main_program.f".

2. BUILD/COMPILE PROCESS  ** Important **

Precompiled executables are included for Windows (64-bit),
64-bit Linux (Intel EM64T and AMD64), and Mac OS X). For other systems, or to
re-compile the code for any reason, follow the instructions below.

Linux and OS X:

The compile and link process to create a WARP3D executable is performed using
"makefiles" and the "make" program on Linux & OS X. We provide an interactive
shell script, "Makewarp.bash", which guides you through the process of 
selecting options to include and then building the code via makefiles. 

We strongly urge you to use ONLY this approach to build WARP3D - it is 
very simple and easy! At a shell command prompt, say %, just enter 
the command "Makewarp.bash".

Windows:

The compile and link process to create a WARP3D executable on Windows is 
performed using a makefile and the "nmake" utility included in 
Windows. nmake is installed as a prerequisite to the Intel Visual Fortran 
Compiler, so if you are planning on re-compiling the code, you already 
have it installed.

We provide a batch script, "Makewarp.bat", which sets up the proper directories
and solvers and builds the code via an nmake file. 

We urge you to use ONLY this approach to build WARP3D on Windows - it is
very simple and easy! Within the command prompt environment that the 
Intel Fortran Compiler creates (in the "start" menu), just "cd" to 
the WARP3D "src" directory and enter the command ".\Makewarp.bat".

Using the individual makefiles without proper knowledge can 
lead to errors in the compiling process. Makefiles for the various 
platforms and versions (omp, mpi_omp) are all named
Makefile.xxx.

==============================================================================


3. SOURCE CODE MARKUPS

We have only one version of the source code. In various *.f files, you
will find statements of the form:

#lnx     dibmck = and( bits(bit),mapvec(word) ) .ne. 0


This statement is included only in the Linux version. Similarly,

!lnx     ........

means that statement is included in all versions but the Linux version.

To handle single vs. double precision, we use statements of the form:

#sgl      real .....

#dbl      double precision ....

Whenever the make file needs to compile a new *.f file, it first
invokes a "filter" program in this directory, e.g., filter_linux.exe
which reads the *.f file and emits a temp.f file properly
"filtered" for that platform, in this case Linux.

The temp.f file is compiled into temp.o but then is renamed to
the correct prefix of *.f and moved to the proper ../obj directory.

The makefiles are set up with very fine grained *.f units to enable
rapid builds and to enable very finely tuned optimization of
individual routines.
