Python 2.7.x is required for warp3d2exii

warp3d2exII is a stand-alone Python program (see also last Section here).
(a copy is also named pat2xii to remain the older naming for a while longer)

warp3d2exii reads in a flat model description file and flat results files

And generates an Exodus II (.exo) file.

The Exodus II format is compatible with Paraview, a free 
post-processing visualization software, and many other pre-
and post- processing software packages (e.g. Cubit).

The "flat" result files were a new feature of WARP3D starting at 
release 17.5.3.

The "flat" model description file was a new feature of WARP3D starting at 
release 17.5.5.

Flat results files are produced with the WARP3D commands of the form

  output flat text displacements ...
  output flat text compressed stresses strains displacements ...
  output flat stream displacements ...
  output flat text element states
  
  See Section 2.12.4 of the WARP3D User Manual for more details.
  
The flat model description file is generated with input
commands of the form

  output model flat patran convention file <file name>  

================================================================================
Using the warp3d2exii Python program 
================================================================================

warp3d2exii is a Python program - it is Python source code executed by
your runtime Python environment.

The Python source code is located in the file:

  $WAR3D_HOME/warp3d2exii/warp3d2exii

This is a command-line program. The program will prompt to enter 
the following information:

1) The filename (and path) for the new Exodus II file.  For example:

      /path/to/file/filename-of-exodus-file

   warp3d2exii overwrites an existing file with no warning and
   automatically appends .exo to the end of the name if not
   already included.

2) The path and filename to the flat model description file 

      /path/to/file/flat_model_file.text

3) The path to the directory containing the flat results files.
   Example

      /path/to/results

4) warp3d2exii parses the contents of the directory name entered in
   step 3 and looks for flat results files.
   
5) warp3d2exii then asks if you want to input the path to a "time map" file.
   This is used mostly for making movies of the results in ParaView.
   WARP3D does not keep track of the actual time value at which each 
   load step occurs (i.e. it does not track tn+1 = tn + dt).  
   
   To use the actual time data in Paraview, you must create a 
   file of <n> positive real numbers, each number on its own line, 
   where <n> is the number of load steps
   in your analysis and the real number on line <i> corresponds 
   to the physical time of load step <i>. 
   
   A yes (y) answer to the prompt

   is then followed by a request to enter the path to 
   the time map file, for example:

      /path/to/file/timemap

6) warp3d2exii executes to completion without further user 
   interaction.
   
   
Efficiency:

   Reading of a flat model description file is very fast.   

   Reading of flat results files, especially stream format, is very fast.
   
   Writing of the final .exo file is reasonably fast with this version.
    
   warp3d2exii issues a message when it finishes and closes the .exo file.
   A very large .exo file (multi GBs) may require several minutes
   to write to disk.


================================================================================
Python Requirements for warp3d2exii
================================================================================

warp3d2exii is built and tested on Python 2.7.3 and later
on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

You will need a working Python environment to use warp3d2exii (in a
Bash shell for Linux and OS X and in the command prompt for
Windows)

Python maybe installed through various free and commercial mechanisms on
each of the platforms. Not all of them work equally well and/or contain the
most common packages. You will need to test your particular implementation.

These mostly standard packages will be imported when warp3d2exii starts up:

   import os
   import os.path
   import time
   import glob   
   from collections import OrderedDict
   import numpy as np
   import re
   import itertools
   import scipy as sp

Use easy_install or pip as needed for your Python implementation
as required to install fortranformat.
