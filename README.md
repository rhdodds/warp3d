Open Source Static and Dynamic Nonlinear Analysis of Solids:  Windows, Linux and Mac OS X Computers

WARP3D is under continuing development as a research code for the solution of large-scale, 3-D solid models subjected to static and dynamic loads. The capabilities of the code focus on fatigue & fracture analyses primarily in metals. WARP3D runs on laptops-to-supercomputers and can analyze models with several million nodes and elements.

We distribute the source code, ready-to-run executables, example problem directories, User Guide and all other supporting files/documentation free of charge under the University of Illinois/NCSA license.

WARP3D is supported on two web sites

1. See http://www.warp3d.net for general and more detailed information, full system downloads, documentation and current notes/issues.

2. This web site on GitHub is used by system developers to update and maintain the software and documentation including all source code, development tools, verification suites.

Most WARP3D users will never need to use this web site (GitHub).
If you want to have the most up-to-date source code, documentation, etc. you may clone this repository. This will not include ready-to-run executables.
You will need to have the (free) git software for distributed source control management tool. git runs on all platforms.
To create a clone of the current development (but working) WARP3D system version, use the following command (in a bash shell on Linux and OS X). Choose any name you want for the directory to hold the clone (below uses warp3d)
git clone https://github.com/rhdodds@gmail.com/warp3d

Follow the step-by-step instructions to rebuild WARP3D executable(s) on a platform provided in the files README_for_xxxx (where xxxx is the platform).
