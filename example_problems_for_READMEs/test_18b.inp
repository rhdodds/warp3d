c    ============================================                       
c 
c            W=2 in,  span/2=4 in, B=0.001 in, a/W=0.15
c            uses crack growth by element extinction
c 
c    nonlinear material, large displacements, bbar,
c    large amounts of ductile crack growth with the Gurson-
c    Tvergaard material model. the finite element model
c    has one-layer of elements with w=0 constraints everywhere
c    to impose plane-strain conditions.
c
c    computational "cell" size is D=200 um. due to symmetry then
c    the elements in the Gurson layer are 100 um x 100 um in size. 
c
c    we intentionally use large increments of imposed displacements
c    at the load point to create severe conditions for the
c    material model integration schemes and the adaptive solution
c    procedures. approximately 14 elements are killed in the first
c    40 load steps. After step ~30 lots of adaptive solutions are
c    present due to negative deformation jacobians in near tip 
c    elements, strain increments > 100 * eps-0 in near-tip
c    elements, integration failure in the material model.
c
c    the algorithms are designed to do whatever adaptivity
c    is required to push forward with the solution. the user
c    can then re-analyze the model with a much more realistic
c    (smaller) load step size.
c
c    J-integral values are computed occasionally during loading.
c
c    a restart file is also written along the way after every
c    10 or so load increments.
c
c    here we employ catastrophic, strain-controlled nucleation
c    to smoothly relax stresses in elements just prior to 
c    actually killing them.
